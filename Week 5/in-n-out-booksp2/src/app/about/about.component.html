    <h1 class="blue">Who is J.K. Rowling?</h1>

    <p>
      J.K. Rowling, born Joanne Rowling on July 31st in 1965, grew up in Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales. The “K” stands for Kathleen,
      which was added by her publisher’s request, who thought a book by an obviously female author might not appeal to the target audience of young boys. Rowling grew up surrounded
      by books, she said, “I lived for books, I was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and National Health spectacles.” She wanted to be a writer from an
      early age, she even wrote her first book at the age of six. It was a story about a rabbit called ‘Rabbit’, and her first novel at 11.

      J.K. Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. The idea was conceived in 1990 while sitting on a delayed train from Manchester to
      London King’s Cross. Over the next five years she began to map out all seven books of the series, and she wrote mostly in longhand and gradually built up a mass of notes,
      many were scribbled on odd scraps of paper. After completing her full manuscript, she sent the first three chapters to a number of literary agents, one of whom wrote back
      asking to see the rest of it. She said it was, “the best letter I had ever received in my life.” The book was published in the US by Scholastic under Harry Potter and the
      Sorcerer’s Stone, in 1998 (again at her publisher’s request). Six titles followed in the Harry Potter series, each achieving record-breaking success.
